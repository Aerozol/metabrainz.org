<h2>Year in review</h2>

<p>
2016 was a transformative year for the MetaBrainz team -- the financial changes in 2015 improved our situation and allowed 
us to hire Laurent Monin (Zas) as our part time system administrator. The timing of this was perfect, because as Zas was 
getting up to speed on our ancient systems, we saw a serious uptick in traffic at the end of 2015. 
</p>

<p>
In January of 2016 it became a consistent problem for us that showed no signs of letting up. In response, we fired up three 
servers we had held in reserve for just such a case, but sadly, we discovered that these servers all had became unreliable as 
they sat unused, further complicating our hosting scenario and not allowing us to improve the quality of our service. It would 
take us many months to finally figure out this mysterious uptick on out traffic; where the traffic came from and how to mitigate it.
</p>

<p>
In January 2016 we also hired Christina Smith to help establish a Spanish representative organization in an effort to setup a 
new headquarters office in Barcelona. Christina researched different Spanish corporate models that would allow us to have a 
pass-thru organization that would be piggy backed off the California 501(c)3 non-profit. 
</p>

<p>
In January we continued with our participation in the <a href="https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2016/01/07/one-month-of-google-code-in/">Google 
Code-In</a> project, which had actually started in December of 2015. A number of high-school aged students from various countries 
claimed and completed tasks for MetaBrainz in the course of the program. Code-in, compared to Summer of Code, focuses on less 
technically challenging tasks, which allows the mentors and students to complete a lot of relatively small tasks can still provide 
a lot of polish for our projects.
</p>

<p>
One of the big winners of our Google Code-in participation was our own BookBrainz project. A lot of students contributed many 
tasks and that led to a release of <a href="https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2016/02/10/bookbrainz-february-2016-release">BookBrainz</a> 
in February. In the same month we were also accepted to the <a href="https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2016/02/29/metabrainz-gsoc-2016/">Google’s 
Summer of Code internship program for 2016</a>! 
</p>

<p>
We kicked off March by <a href="https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2016/03/01/say-hello-to-discourse/">moving our forums to the Discourse 
platform</a>. Discourse was intended to combine the defunct mailing lists that had been seeing a decrease in traffic over the years 
and our old online forums. Previously it has been hard for us combine both of these as their respective user groups were never interested 
in using the other technology, which split our community into two. Discourse is of high enough quality that it allowed us to consolidate 
both mailing lists and forums into one technology that works well. 
</p>

<p>
Also in March we found that the site <a href="https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2016/03/16/6-degrees-of-vince-gill">Six Degrees of Vince 
Gill</a> is powered by MusicBrainz data! For a less fun aspect, we had to deal with a questionable web organization that aimed to 
<a href="https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2016/03/08/beware-of-the-web-sherriff">whitewash the origin of one of their artists</a>. When 
MusicBrainz was founded, we had no idea that we would get involved in tricky issues like this one! 
</p>

<p>
In April we finally signed a lease on an office in Barcelona and started the slow process of getting the utilities set up and finding 
furniture for the office. It would take until nearly June to get the office ready for people to actually work there. For a while we 
even <a href="https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2016/05/26/desperate-time">powered our office router off a solar panel</a>!
</p>

<p>
In May we had a difficult schema change release. Most of what happened was <a href="https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2016/05/25/schema-change-release-what-happened">laid 
out in our blog</a>, but to sum it up: This release was drastically complicated by our aging infrastructure, further fueling the 
need to moving to a new hosting provider. 
</p>

<p>
After the schema change release was complete, we called an all-hands-on-deck emergency phase for our project to plan and execute a 
move to a new hosting provider. We started planning and evaluating service providers; eventually we decided to move to Hetzner in 
Germany and to move our hosting infrastructure to the Docker software containerization system. 
</p>

<p>
All of the sudden we had a ton of work to do with a great sense of urgency -- we had to get our services stable soon, so we put our 
heads down and worked. And you can see this happening as the number of blog posts on our blog died down in the latter half of 2016, 
since we had nothing new to report while we feverishly worked towards modernizing our hosting.
</p>

<p>
In July Christina left the team after a number of conflicts that ultimately required the help of the board of directors to sort 
out and resolve. In August we <a href="https://blog.musicbrainz.org/2016/08">published our Google Summer of Code results</a> -- GSoC seemed 
to be the only relief we got from working on our move.
</p>

<p>
In November it was finally time to make the move to Hetzner -- a very challenging move was further complicated by the loss of a file 
in the migration, which made maintaining our Live Data Feed a challenge, to say the least. Overall the site was migrated to Hetzner 
and our old hosting setup in California broken down. MusicBrainz remained in read-only state for a few days as we ensured that the 
new infrastructure was stable enough for us to enable writes to our database again.
</p>

<p>
We spent the remainder of the year working to get our new services cleaned up at Hetzner -- we had left quite a few loose ends that 
needed wrapping up. Between that and learning how our new infrastructure worked we were kept busy through the end of the year. 
</p>


<h2>New Supporters</h2>

<p>
2016 was a good year for picking up new supporters. Our new website from 2015 was starting to bear fruit and we saw a number of 
companies join our supporters. In June Barcelona based BMAT and US based Wolfram Research both became Bronze supporters. In 
September the London based Soundmouse became a Silver supporter and Ticketmaster joined in November and SiriusXM in December, 
both at Unicorn level.
</p>

<p>
The new heavy hitting supporters toward the end of the year allowed us to start thinking about growing them team further!
</p>


<h2>Traffic</h2>

<p>
At the end of 2015 we had a sharp uptick in traffic that caused our servers to overload -- at that point in time it was unclear 
where that traffic was coming from and we had no means to really analyze our situation. As 2016 got under way, we started making 
concrete plans to find a new hosting provider and what it would entail to move our services.
</p>

<p>
We still had not been able to setup our traffic analysis software in 2016, so we only have a rough sketch of what was happening 
to our traffic. For most of 2016 we had a lot of traffic hitting us that we didn’t know where it was coming from. Zas spent quite 
a few weeks trying to make sense of this mysterious traffic. He started blocking the traffic that we could not identify and waited 
for people to complain that they couldn't reach MusicBrainz.
</p>

<p>
As blocked people started contacting us for help, Zas slowly started picking up on the fact that all blocked users had a QNAP NAS 
in their local home network. After a lot of digging it became clear that QNAP’s NAS product had started using our API without ever 
having a discussion about this with us. We proceeded to block their traffic more effectively and started to find a way to discuss 
the matter with QNAP directly.
</p>

<p>
Before our move to Hetzner we had old servers coupled expensive bandwidth and loads of traffic that we couldn't quite cope with -- 
we were limited to 35 mbit/s of outgoing traffic. After our move to Hetzner our traffic jumped to 120 mbits/s! Blocking the QNAP 
traffic and improving the controls of bad traffic to our API allowed us to make our systems relatively stable again, with bandwidth 
usage leveling off at 70 mbit/s.
</p>

<p>
After the move we had vastly more servers at our disposal and we immediately increased the rate at which we started serving 
successful traffic. Our services immediately became more stable serving traffic more constantly. The response time on our web pages 
and our API started improving as we got the new system to be stable. At this point we started collecting a different set of metrics 
that measure the performance of our systems, but we don’t have enough data for 2016 to provide a better thumbnail of our traffic. We 
hope that our 2017 report will change that significantly.
</p>


<h2>Finances</h2>

<p>
In 2016 we earned the following income:

<p>
Our revenue increased over the course of 2016, removing more financial pressure, allowing us some more breathing room. 
Moving to Hetzner initially saved money and expected our expenditures there would be far less for a couple of years to come, 
while the services we’re receiving are considerably greater than what we had available in California.
</p>

<p>
At the end of 2016 we had gotten rid of all of our servers and are now renting servers from Hetzner in Germany. Going 
forward this means that we no longer have servers to fiscally depreciate or otherwise worry about. If a server fails we 
submit a ticket and someone else has to worry about fixing the server. This was a game changer for our entire team!
</p>

<p>
In the course of 2016 we spent $844.84 on hardware, mostly related to preparing for our move to Hetzner. We spent 
$20,325.00 on hosting in California and $7,621.16 on our new infrastructure. Including $1,702.79 for some Google Cloud 
hosting, the total hosting cost came to $29,648.95 for 2016.
</p>

<p>
This compares to $24,375.00 in 2015, which means that our costs of operating the service were a little higher in 2016. 
Most of this increased cost was related to starting up new infrastructure in Germany; paying setup-costs and for duplicated 
hosting infrastructures for almost two months.
</p>

<p>
In 2016 we spent $75,253.49 on salaries for developers, down from $81,378.25 in 2016. But we also hired a system administrator, 
so our total expenditure on technical contractors grew to $100,489.02. After a complete year of having a community manager, we 
spent $22,272.57. We also spent $8,009.64 for customer support and our costs for administration was $80,602.86.
</p>

<p>
2016 was the first full year after changing how we charge for support; here is the breakdown of how we generated revenue from 
our open data:
</p>

<table class="table table-condensed table-bordered table-striped finances">
  <tbody>
  <tr><th colspan="2">Income</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Support - Bronze</td><td>$ 24,830.54</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Support - Silver</td><td>$ 18,049.11</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Support - Gold</td><td>$ 6,000.00</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Support - Unicorn</td><td>$ 165,579.88</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Support - Mobile</td><td>$ 245.54</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Support - Development</td><td>$ 39,600.00</td></tr>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
In 2015 we had earned only $146,130.00 from licensing our data and support payments. In 2016, this grew to $254,305.07! The 
two largest factors that led to this growth are that we asked more companies for support and that our data has been growing and 
becoming more relevant to the industry.
</p>

<p>
The Bronze category has the largest number of customers, with almost 20 supporters in 2016, yet it doesn’t earn a lot of money, 
$24,830.54, since many of those supporters have limited income or make limited use of our data. If you compare this to our Unicorn 
level where large companies normally come in, you’ll see far fewer supporters, but with considerably much more income at $165,579.88. 
Finally, the Development category was an anomaly for 2016 -- in 2016 we received payment from Google for the JSON-LD contract we 
completed for them in 2015.
</p>

<p>
You can also see that the mobile tier didn’t pan out as we had thought -- in fact no mobile application has ever generated any real 
income. Just from these numbers we can deduce that mobile isn’t a big market for us and also that if we wish to increase income, we 
should go Unicorn hunting, rather than searching for Bronze.
</p>

<p>
Our end user donations via PayPal came to $6,177.44, down from $7,985.93 in 2015. This is far less than our donations of 2012, when 
they exceeded $14,000. We still have no explanation for this! Direct/large donations added up to $43,521.36, including $40,000 annual 
support from Google’s Open Source Programs Office and some cash donations from smaller donors. Google also sponsored our annual summit 
for $4,189.15. Thank you Google!

<h2>Server Farm</h2>

<p>
Sadly, with the move to Hetzner in Germany where we rent servers and have no physical access to them, we cannot 
show you a pretty picture of our servers.
</p>

<p>
Our new hosting infrastructure uses artist names for servers, with some heavy hitters naming some of our most important servers:
</p>

<ul>
   <li>Bowie / Queen: Our database servers with 12 cores, 128GB of RAM and RAID-1,0 SSD disks.</li>
   <li>Zappa, Ludwig, Serge, Trille, Hip, Bootsy: General servers with 8 cores, 64GB of RAM and NVMe solid state disks in RAID-1.</li>
   <li>Prince / Boingo: General servers with 8 cores, 64GB of ram, generic solid state disk  RAID-1 drives.</li>
   <li>Kiki / Herb: Gateway servers with 8 cores, 32GB of RAM, generic solid state disk  RAID-1 drives</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is a total of 12 machines that are handling vastly more traffic than the 21 machines that we had in service 
in California. Admittedly, the servers we had in California were a mixed bag -- the better ones were reasonably modern, 
but we had a large array of donated servers that had their best days behind them. It was never an ideal setup, but it 
allowed us to grow from 3 servers in 2006 to 21 servers in 2018 without spending a huge amount of money on hosting/servers.
</p>

<p>
We started the year with 35mbit/s of traffic, peaked at 120mbit/s of traffic shortly after our move and finally settled 
on 70mbit/s of traffic towards the end of the year. The uptime of all of our services drastically improved and the response 
times of all of our services dropped significantly after our move. Our search servers were still relics from a past era that 
continued to impact our uptime on a regular basis, but overall site reliability was drastically improved by our move to Hetzner.
</p>


<h2>Words of appreciation</h2>

<p>
Many thanks to our editors, voters, peer reviewers, bug watchers and other members of our community -- without you MetaBrainz 
would not be what it is today!
</p>

<p>
We'd like to also thank our developers that pushed out dozens of releases of the site, Picard, client libraries, AcousticBrainz, BookBrainz,
CritiqueBrainz, ListenBrainz and the Cover Art Archive. All of your work is critical to enabling the MetaBrainz community to do its job.
</p>

<p>
We'd also like to thank our awesome Board of Directors and all of the donors who contributed money and all of our supporters

Year in Review

2017 was a year of growth for MetaBrainz, complete with some growing pains. 

The year started off with us hiring https://blog.metabrainz.org/2017/01/16/welcome-to-the-team-elizabeth/ Elizabeth Bigger, aka Quesito, as our supporter catalyst. Her job involved being our primary contact for supporters, on-boarding new supporters, sending invoices and following up on unpaid invoices. 

In February we also finished off another successful participation in 
https://blog.metabrainz.org/2017/02/07/wrapping-up-google-code%e2%80%90in-2016/ Google Code-in, that resulted in Anshuman Agarwal and Daniel Hsing becoming Grand Prize winners! Congratulations to both of you! In the same month we also got accepted to https://blog.metabrainz.org/2017/02/28/metabrainz-has-been-accepted-to-summer-of-code-2017 another round of GSoC!!

In March https://blog.metabrainz.org/2017/03/13/weve-hired-another-musicbrainz-developer we hired Yvan Rivierre from France as another contractor to work on MusicBrainz with Bitmap. Yvan had been submitting various new features to MusicBrainz previously, so he was not new to our team, making it easy to bring him on board.

April was pretty quiet, with just a Picard release and a MusicBrainz server release; however, most of our time was spent preparing for our https://blog.metabrainz.org/2017/05/16/schema-change-release-2017-05-15-including-upgrade-instructions/ schema change release, which happened on May 15 as scheduled.

In June we took an uncharacteristic step and https://blog.metabrainz.org/2017/06/14/openscore-liberating-sheet-music/ supported a Kickstarter that was near and dear to us. Our friends from MuseScore https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/openscore/openscore-join-the-sheet-music-revolution created a Kickstarter project to liberate several pieces of sheet music and to place these transcriptions into the public domain. We managed to sponsor the transcription of Beethoven’s 5th!

With the help of Param Singh (aka iliekcomputers) and his GSoC work, we https://blog.metabrainz.org/2017/07/28/listenbrainz-enters-beta-stage/ moved ListenBrainz to beta in July after several months worth of intense hacking to revamp core technologies and to make things more stable. In August we https://blog.metabrainz.org/2017/08/ published the results of the student Google Summer of Code projects, which capped off a successful season of Code-In and Summer of Code.

Unfortunately the relationship between Quesito and the Foundation deteriorated over the summer and her contract was not renewed. She raised a number of issues with the board of directors, who proceeded to launch an investigation into the situation. This would take through the end of the year to resolve.

https://blog.metabrainz.org/2017/09/06/expanding-our-team/ In September we also saw more team changes. Roman Tsukanov decided to not renew his contract and to replace him we hired two of our Summer of Code students. We hired both Param Singh (working on ListenBrainz, CritiqueBrainz and AcousticBrainz!) and Sambhav Kothari (aka samj1912) working on Picard and picking up the languishing Solr search project to replace our old search servers.

In September we also held our https://blog.metabrainz.org/2017/09/29/live-streaming-mb-summit-17/ annual summit in Barcelona, complete with a live stream of the event. We posted the https://blog.metabrainz.org/2017/11/03/metabrainz-summit-17/ summary of the summit to our blog.

The remainder of the year was fairly quiet and we only had the usual server releases and other community activity.
New Supporters

The high end audio gear manufacturer https://www.naimaudio.com/ Naim joined as a Gold supporter in February and the concert promoter AEG Presents joined on the Unicorn tier at end end of march.

In May the audio experience company Qroom joined as a Bronze support and in August another high end audio gear company, http://www.bryston.com/ Byston, also joined on the Bronze tier

In 2017 we also had another company join as on the Unicorn tier, but this company wasn’t ready to reveal this new relationship at the time, so we cannot yet mention its name.

Traffic

When the year started, we were still suffering from the invalid QNAP traffic and we were receiving 2,000 requests/second. A lot of our services hadn’t become stable yet since moving to Hetzner and it took us nearly half the year to get our services fully stable on the new hosting infrastructure. Towards the end of the year as QNAP NAS’ were being updated, the traffic had dropped to 1,300 requests/second. To put that into context, about 265 requests/second were legitimate traffic that we honored; from mid-2017 we were able to respond to 100% valid requests against our web sites and APIs. 

The mean response time on MusicBrainz website was between 400 ms and 500 ms, and between 70 ms at the start of the year and 30 ms at end of the year for the web service. While the web service improved greatly, the response time for our web pages was far too slow. Most of these slow response times were caused by our aging search servers and really slow template generation for our web pages.

To address both of these issues, we focused our energy on re-starting work on our new Solr based search system that had been in-progress for several years. We also decided to move our web page rendering to the modern React toolkit, but realized that it would take many months of work to make this transition.

We hit our peak traffic in mid-May when we received 25 mbit/s and transmitted 125 mbits/s. At the end of the year we were receiving 14 mbit/s and transmitting 67 mbit/s and our systems were finally stable after a turbulent year of improving our hosting infrastructure.

Excess income:     $ 73,567.68


Our revenue continued to increase over the course of 2017! While we reduced our hosting costs in 2017, the biggest change was bringing on more supporters and having the supporters who joined late in 2016 start paying us.

In the course of 2017 we spent $618.86 on hardware for team/community needs not related to hosting. In total we spent $26,092.01 on hosting at Hetzner, Google Cloud and Amazon AWS, down from $29,648.95 for 2016. Our overall hosting costs have increased a little as compared to costs from our California hosting, but we are operating more sites with more throughput and much lower response times.

In 2017 we spent $ 84,326.52 on salaries for developers, up from $ 75,253.49 in 2016. We also spent $ 35,403.38 for system administration, $ 23,369.21 for community management, $ 17,221.87 for supporter management, $ 9,877.09 on customer support and $ 82,417.66 on administration. Paying for our contractors remains our biggest cost, as it is customary for most businesses.

In 2016 we had earned $ 254,305.07 from licensing our data and that grew to $ 312,683.86 in 2017. We also earned $ 15,000 from one supporter that sponsored the development of our new JSON data dumps for MusicBrainz. Our income from licensing our data continues to increase due to us taking on more customers, both from changing our business model in 2015 and more supporters needing to use our data.

The silver and gold supporter categories picked up in 2017; also we gave up on the mobile tier in 2017 and instead created a stealth supporter category which is designated for companies that are supporting us, but do not yet have a public product and wish to remain out of the spotlight. While this category gave us more income than the mobile tier, we can see that stealth supporters are also not contributing much to our bottom line.

Our end user donations via PayPal came to $ 6,126.96 which is nearly unchanged from 2016 when they were $ 6,177.44. Direct/large donations added up to $ 32,353.01, including $ 30,000 annual support from Google’s Open Source Programs Office and some cash donations from smaller donors. Google also sponsored our annual summit for $ 5,000 and the sponsorship payment from 2016 hit our account in 2017, thus the financial categories above show $ 10,000 in summit support. A big thank you to Google for supporting our mission and our summits!

A growing spam problem

Most of 2017 saw a very rapid growth of new accounts on MusicBrainz and also an increase of noticeable spam in the system. For most of 2017 between 350 and 1,000 new accounts were created each day. The https://blog.metabrainz.org/2017/09/20/server-update-2017-09-18/ September 18th MusicBrainz server update caused a big drop in new accounts, having it hover just below/around 200 new users a day, which means that up to 800 of the daily new users until October were likely spam accounts. There are still some spam accounts getting created, but for most of MusicBrainz’s history we’ve gotten around 150–200 new accounts per day, so it’s hard to say currently how many of the new accounts are actually spam accounts.

But even if we don’t see as many new spam accounts anymore, we do at least have a big collection of old, dormant spam accounts. To both fight new, incoming spam and clean up all of the old spam, we started planning a new project in 2017: SpamBrainz. The idea for SpamBrainz is that it should analyse user information as well as edits made to the database to see whether they look like spam, and allow humans (MusicBrainz editors with the https://tickets.metabrainz.org/browse/MBS-9480 “spam ninja” denomination) to agree or disagree with this classification. SpamBrainz didn’t see a lot of progress in 2017 beyond the planning of a Summer of Code project for 2018.



Server Farm

At the end of 2017 we had the following servers hosting our sites for us:

Bowie / Queen: Our database servers with 12 cores, 128GB of RAM and RAID-1,0 SSD disks. 
Zappa, Ludwig, Serge, Trille, Hip, Bootsy, Williams, Lemmy: General servers with 8 cores, 64GB of RAM and NVMe solid state disks in RAID-1.
Prince / Boingo: General servers with 8 cores, 64GB of ram, generic solid state disk  RAID-1 drives.
Burnside, yehudi, whetton, cage: Cheaper and more capable general servers with 12 cores, 64GB of RAM and solid state disks in RAID-1.
Kiki / Herb: Gateway servers with 8 cores, 32GB of RAM, generic solid state disk  RAID-1 drives
Spike: This machine runs the AcousticBrainz project hosted at Hetzner, but was rented before we committed to move all of our hosting to Hetzner, so it isn’t part of the normal MetaBrainz hosting setup. 12 cores, 128GB of RAM and RAID-1

This is a total of 19 machines, with each of the machines in our main MetaBrainz cluster running Docker. All of our services are broken down into containers, which allows us to easily start/move/stop services between servers in order to efficiently use all of the machines.

In early 2017 we added two more servers, Williams and Lemmy with the goal of using them for analytics and ListenBrainz respectively. Later in the year Hetzner started offering more capable and cheaper AMD based servers, so we expanded our setup with Burnside, Yehudi, Whetton and Cage to mainly add more MusicBrainz web page capacity.

Zas and all of our engineers continued to work all throughout 2017 to make our sites more robust, respond faster and be more redundant. 2017 marked a vast improvement of for the reliability of all of our sites. This caused the overall sleep for the MetaBrainz engineering team to improve pretty significantly.

Words of Appreciation

Many thanks to our editors, voters, peer reviewers, bug watchers and other members of our community -- without you MetaBrainz would not be what it is today!

We'd like to also thank our developers that pushed out dozens of releases of the site, Picard, client libraries, AcousticBrainz, CritiqueBrainz, ListenBrainz and the Cover Art Archive. All of your work is critical to enabling the MetaBrainz community to do its job.

We'd also like to thank our awesome Board of Directors and all of the donors who contributed money and all of our supporters who make it possible for us to employ a team of open source hackers scattered across the globe.

In particular we'd like to thank Google for its annual support and the support of our summit. These large contributions allow us to carry on with our mission of making MusicBrainz the most comprehensive music encyclopedia out there and pressing on with making our other projects more relevant.

Thank you to everyone who contributed in 2017!
