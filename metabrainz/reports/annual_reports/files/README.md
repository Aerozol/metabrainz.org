How to create a new annual report:

1. Create a new directory for a year (for example *2014*).
2. In created directory add *content.html* file with contents of the annual report.

You can add static files into the report. To do that insert files into directory
for a specific year. After that you can reference them like this:

    <img src="files/2014/traffic.png" />
