  <h2>Individuals</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Richard Jones donated <b>$50,000</b> in 2010 (<a href="http://blog.musicbrainz.org/?p=539">blog post</a>).</li>
    <li>Our ever helpful <a href="http://metabrainz.org/">Board of Directors</a>.</li>
    <li>All the <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/doc/About/Team">people who make MusicBrainz happen</a> on a day-to-day basis.</li>
    <li>And of course, <a href="http://metabrainz.org/donations/by-amount">everyone who has donated</a> to the MetaBrainz Foundation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Supporters</h2>
  <p>The following organizations have provided valuable support. We are very grateful for all that they've done and for all that they continue doing.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <b><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a></b> selected MusicBrainz as its music metadata partner in 2007 and has since been using our data to supplement their artist profiles and album reviews on their <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music">music site</a>.</li>
    <li><b><a href="http://www.oracle.com/sun">Sun Microsystems</a></b> donated a $11,000 server in December 2006 to help us manage our increasing traffic (<a href="http://blog.musicbrainz.org/?p=230">blog post</a>).</li>
    <li><b><a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a></b> created the open license that enables our business model to thrive.</li>
    <li><b><a href="http://oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Media</a></b> gave MusicBrainz $500 to start off a bank account for the project before the MetaBrainz Foundation existed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Other support</h2>
  <p>
    Many people have helped us in uncountable ways over the years. Help ranges from minor support like putting up Robert Kaye in a hotel room for a night, a posh flat for a week, a free meal here or there or in kind donations.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ben Chobot donated two beefy servers in 2008 that make up our search back-bone and Chad Wilson donated cash to purchase a much needed switch for the MusicBrainz servers.</li>
    <li>John Buckman of <a href="http://magnatune.com">Magnatune</a> has put up Robert Kaye in his spare and very posh flat in London a number of times. With the hotel costs in London, this is a non-trivial amount of support.</li>
    <li>Derek Sivers of <a href="http://cdbaby.com">CD Baby</a> provided hotel accommodations, use of his spare flat in Portland, and countless dinners to Robert Kaye.</li>
    <li>Ed Cavazos from <a href="http://fr.com">Fish &amp; Richardson</a> provides ongoing pro-bono legal advice for the occasional Intellectual Property questions that MusicBrainz faces.</li>
    <li>Dan Appleman with <a href="http://www.hewm.com">Heller Ehrman LLP</a> provides ongoing help crafting contracts for licensing our data.</li>
    <li><a href="http://theblight.net">Neil Girling</a> provided a fully loaded Apple G5 machine for use in the MetaBrainz Foundation headquarters.</li>
  </ul>
