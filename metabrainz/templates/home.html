      The MetaBrainz Foundation is a non-profit that believes in free, open
      access to data. It has been set up to build community maintained
      databases and make them available in the public domain or under Creative
      Commons licenses. Our data is mostly gathered by volunteers, and verified
      by a voting system to make sure it is consistent and correct. All
      non-commercial use is free, but commercial users are asked to pay for
      regular updates of the data in order to help fund the project. We
      encourage all data users to contribute to the data gathering process so
      that our data can be as comprehensive as possible.
