  <p>
    All of our data dumps are available under Creative Commons licenses.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, in order to 
    keep the MetaBrainz Foundation operating to update and improve these data sets, <b>we require
    support from our commercial users</b>. Without this support, these datasets cannot be maintained,
    so we rely on financial support from commercial users. Even though a data set may be available
    under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license (public domain), we still require commercial
    users to support us, on a moral basis, not a legal one!

  <a id="musicbrainz"><h3>MusicBrainz Postgres Data Dumps</h3></a>

  <p>
     This data dump includes all public portions of the data from our MusicBrainz project. All artists,
     releases, recordings, labels and the relationships between them, and much more data, including
     everything needed to run your own copy of MusicBrainz, is included.
  </p>

  <p> 
     The MusicBrainz data dumps include all public portions of the data from our MusicBrainz project.
     This includes (but is not limited to) artists, releases, labels, the relationships between them
     and much more data that you can find in the MusicBrainz database. In addition, there is a full
     history of all the changes that the MusicBrainz community has made to the data, and average
     ratings and tag counts (including genre tags) added by the community are also made available.
  </p> 

  <p>
     These data dumps are intended to be imported into a PostgreSQL database; we recommend that you use
     the <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/musicbrainz-docker">musicbrainz-docker</a> project to
     import these dumps. Working with them on their own or attempting to import that data into a different
     database system than PostgreSQL represents a non-trivial amount of work and we strongly recommend
     against doing that.
  </p> 

  <p>
     MetaBrainz provides full database exports of the MusicBrainz database twice a week. More regular
     (and comfortable) updates are possible by keeping a local mirror in sync with the main MusicBrainz
     database via the <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Live_Data_Feed">Live Data Feed</a>. The
     MusicBrainz data dumps can be found on the
     <a href="http://ftp.musicbrainz.org/pub/musicbrainz/data/fullexport/">MusicBrainz FTP Server</a>
     and more information on the contents of the various dump files, including licensing information,
     can be found in the MusicBrainz documentation.

  <a id="musicbrainz-json"><h3>MusicBrainz JSON Data Dumps</h3></a>
  <p>
     MetaBrainz also provides access to the music metadata in the MusicBrainz database in the easily
     consumable format of JSON documents. If you simply cannot work with Postgres and you prefer to work
     with a document oriented data store, then this data dump is suited for this purpose.
  </p> 

  <p>
     There are individual dump files for each of the following data entities in MusicBrainz: Area, Artist, Event,
     Instrument, Label, Place, Recording, Release Group, Release, Series and Work. Please note that 
     in order to make these data dumps easy to import, the data is not normalized and will contain duplicate
     data.

  <a id="listenbrainz"><h3>ListenBrainz Postgres Data Dumps</h3></a>

  <p>
     The ListenBrainz project serves as an archive where users can store their music listening history.
     ListenBrainz then provides users with insights into their listening behaviors by creating detailed
     statistics reports from the provided data as well as other social features focused on music.
  </p> 

  <p>
     This dataset can be used to create study music consumption patterns, create new music data-sets.
     ListenBrainz itself is using this data to power a music recommendation engine and to create other
     derived data-sets.. The provided data dumps contain 100s of millions of listens in the ListenBrainz
     database and is rather large. Due to its size, we cannot provide this data in other formats and
     only twice a month. Incremental daily dumps are also available, which provide listen data that 
     was added since the last full dump, one dump file for each day.

  <a id="critiquebrainz"><h3>CritiqueBrainz Postgres Data Dumps</h3></a>

  <p>
     CritiqueBrainz is a repository for Creative Commons licensed music and book reviews. It fills the gap
     between the factual music metadata in the MusicBrainz database and book metadata in the BookBrainz
     database, the opinions about music from music critics and books from book critics, listeners and
     readers by providing a platform that archives Creative Commons licensed reviews.
  </p> 

  <p>
     The MetaBrainz foundation provides full dumps of the CritiqueBrainz database as well as JSON dumps
     containing reviews in an easily consumable format. These datasets are updated every day and can be
     downloaded from the MusicBrainz FTP Server.
