  <h2>Database Dumps</h2>


  <a id="musicbrainz"><h3>MusicBrainz Postgres Data Dumps</h3></a>

  <p>
     The MusicBrainz data dumps include all public portions of the data from our MusicBrainz project.
     This includes but is not limited to artists, releases, labels, the relationships between them and
     much more data that you can find in the MusicBrainz database. In addition, there is a full history
     of all the changes that the MusicBrainz community has made to the data.
  </p>

  <p> 
     These data dumps are intended to be imported into a Postgres database; we recommend that you use the
     musicbrainz-docker project to import these dumps. Working with them on their own or attempting to
     import that data into some other database system represents a non-trivial amount of work and we
     strongly recommend against doing that.
  </p> 

  <p>
     MetaBrainz provides full database exports of the MusicBrainz database updated regularly and can be
     kept in sync with the main MusicBrainz database via the Live Data Feed. The MusicBrainz data dumps
     can be found on the MusicBrainz FTP Server and more information on the contents of the various dump
     files, including licensing information, can be found in the MusicBrainz documentation.

  <a id="musicbrainz-json"><h3>MusicBrainz JSON Data Dumps</h3></a>
  <p>
     MetaBrainz also provides access to the music metadata in the MusicBrainz database in the easily
     consumable format of JSON documents. If you simply cannot work with Postgres and you prefer to work
     with a document oriented data store, then this data dump is suited for this purpose.
  </p> 

  <p>
     These JSON dumps can be downloaded from the MusicBrainz FTP Server, and more information on the
     contents of the dumps can be found in the MusicBrainz documentation. These dumps are CC0 licensed
     but we ask commercial users to support us in order to help fund the creation and maintenance of
     these datasets.

  <a id="listenbrainz"><h3>ListenBrainz Postgres Data Dumps</h3></a>

  <p>
     The ListenBrainz project serves as an archive where users can store their music listening history.
     ListenBrainz then provides users with insights into their listening behaviors by creating detailed
     statistics reports from the provided data as well as other social features focused on music.
  </p> 

  <p>
     This dataset can be used to create study music consumption patterns, create new music data-sets.
     ListenBrainz itself is using this data to power a music recommendation engine and to create other
     derived data-sets.. The provided data dumps contain 100s of millions of listens in the ListenBrainz
     database and is rather large. Due to its size, we cannot provide this data in other formats.
  </p> 

  <p>
     The ListenBrainz project creates new data dumps every two weeks, on the 1st and 15th of every month.
     These data dumps are CC0 licensed and can be downloaded from the MusicBrainz FTP Server. For more
     information, please visit the ListenBrainz website and the ListenBrainz data dumps documentation.

  <a id="critiquebrainz"><h3>CritiqueBrainz Postgres Data Dumps</h3></a>

  <p>
     CritiqueBrainz is a repository for Creative Commons licensed music and book reviews. It fills the gap
     between the factual music metadata in the MusicBrainz database and book metadata in the BookBrainz
     database, the opinions about music from music critics and books from book critics, listeners and
     readers by providing a platform that archives Creative Commons licensed reviews.
  </p> 

  <p>
     The MetaBrainz foundation provides full dumps of the CritiqueBrainz database as well as JSON dumps
     containing reviews in an easily consumable format. These datasets are updated every day and can be
     downloaded from the MusicBrainz FTP Server.
