        "description": "The MetaBrainz Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to creating and maintaining open data projects that provide reliable, structured metadata for various forms of media. Established in 2004 by Robert Kaye, MetaBrainz seeks to build free and accessible knowledge repositories while fostering collaboration within an open community. The foundation operates under an open data and open-source ethos, which means its data and tools are freely available for public use, distribution, and modification. This openness encourages developers, researchers, and organizations to contribute and create derivative projects, ultimately enriching the ecosystem around open media metadata.\nAmong the primary projects under MetaBrainz is MusicBrainz, an extensive music database offering metadata on artists, albums, tracks, and release information. Created in response to the proprietary nature of early music metadata services, MusicBrainz empowers users to contribute to and curate an accurate, user-driven music knowledge base. With applications ranging from digital music libraries to tagging software like Picard, MusicBrainz has become a foundational resource for music metadata, attracting contributions from users, as well as support from major companies like Google and the BBC.\nAnother notable project, ListenBrainz, focuses on tracking music listening habits. Inspired by projects like Last.fm, ListenBrainz records and analyzes listening data from users who can share this information to explore trends, recommendations, and personal analytics. As with other MetaBrainz projects, ListenBrainz data is open and accessible, allowing researchers and developers to build upon this data for music recommendations, research, and social features.\nBookBrainz, the foundation’s third major project, is an open database for book metadata, following a similar structure to MusicBrainz but tailored for literature. BookBrainz aims to catalog authors, works, editions, and other entities in the literary world. This data is freely accessible, making it an invaluable resource for libraries, researchers, and readers who want a comprehensive, community-driven book database.\nMetaBrainz Foundation’s commitment to open-source software is integral to its mission. All software it develops, including the tools, APIs, and data structures, is released under open-source licenses. This transparency ensures the data remains free for everyone, regardless of commercial or non-commercial use, while encouraging innovation and contributions from a global user base.\nMetaBrainz is primarily funded through partnerships and sponsorships, relying on support from institutions like Internet Archive and donations from its user community. This structure allows MetaBrainz to remain independent and committed to its mission of providing high-quality, freely available data to benefit both users and the digital information landscape.",

            "description": "MusicBrainz is a community-maintained open source encyclopedia of music information. This means that anyone — including you — can help contribute to the project by adding information about your favorite artists and their works.\n In 2000, Gracenote took over the free CDDB project and commercialized it, essentially charging users for accessing the very data they themselves contributed. In response, Robert Kaye founded MusicBrainz. The project has since grown rapidly from a one-man operation to an international community of enthusiasts that appreciates both music and music metadata. Along the way, the scope of the project has expanded from its origins as a mere CDDB replacement to the true music encyclopedia MusicBrainz is today.\n As an encyclopedia and as a community, MusicBrainz exists only to collect as much information about music as we can. We do not discriminate or prefer one 'type' of music over another, and we try to collect information about as many different types of music as possible. Whether it is published or unpublished, popular or fringe, western or non-western, human or non-human — we want it all in MusicBrainz.\n The MusicBrainz Database stores all of the various pieces of information we collect about music, from artists and their releases to works and their composers, and much more. Note: We do not actually store or have access to any of the music recordings!\n Most of the data in the MusicBrainz Database is licensed under CC0, which effectively places the data into the Public Domain. That means that anyone can download the data and use it in any way they want. The remaining data is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 license.",
