  <h1>Sponsors</h1>

  <p>
    The MetaBrainz Foundation wishes to offer a huge thank you to all of our sponsors and partners for their support in helping MusicBrainz operate.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of the following organizations and individuals have provided funding, others have supported us by providing access to tools and technologies that have helped us grow. In either case they played a significant role in the success and growth of MusicBrainz.
  </p>
  <p>We would not exist without you â€” <b>Thank You!</b></p>

  <h2>Special thanks</h2>

  <p>
     In our past, we've had a lot of people support us with many different levels of support: Access to conferences, covering
     travel expenses, large personal donations and countless meals. These have become too numerous to list, but we wanted
     to note a few individuals who have made a big difference for us.
  </p>

  <p>
     Richard Jones of <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm fame</a> donated <b>$50,000</b> in 2010, 
     <a href="http://www.oracle.com/sun">Sun Microsystems</a> & Paul Lamere for donated a database server and
     <a href="http://oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Media</a></b> gave MusicBrainz $500 to start off a bank account for the project 
     before the MetaBrainz Foundation existed. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edcavazos">Ed Cavazos</a> periodically
